# Project-owned build script.
#
# ci-job-smoke.yml's Build job never changes to build a different project or
# board -- it only ever runs `.github/user/build/build.sh`. Everything
# specific to *this* project (which board, which core, which sketch, how to
# compile it) lives here instead, so changing the build process never means
# touching the workflow.
#
# Contract with the workflow:
#   - Runs from the repository root, after checkout.
#   - Must leave exactly one *.bin file inside ./build/ (the whole
#     directory is uploaded as the artifact; the Upload job finds that one
#     file by extension, not by name, so it can be called anything).
